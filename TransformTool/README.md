TransformTool
=============

A Free Transform Tool for manipulating objects in 2D space.

2 versions of the Transform Tool are available, each with mostly different implementations:

* ActionScript 3.0
* JavaScript
 

# ActionScript Version

This is an incomplete but mostly functional and fully featured version of the Transform Tool.  Not everything works 100% but most of the juicy stuff is there.

# JavaScript Version


This probably isn't ready for production work, but will get you most of the way there.  There are no dependencies, and I don't think the code would be too terribly complex to adapt.

There are two sub-versions, one using canvas, and the other using SVG to transform DOM elements built off of the canvas implementation.
